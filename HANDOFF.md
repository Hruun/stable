# ü§ñ AGENT HANDOFF DOCUMENT

## üìã Current Status: READY FOR NEXT AGENT

**Repository Status**: ‚úÖ Clean and synchronized  
**Branch**: `main` - up to date with origin  
**Last Commit**: `c89e08c` - Advanced word matching implemented  
**Next Agent**: Continue with timestamp editing workflow improvements  

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. Race Condition Bug Fix ‚úÖ
**Status**: Fully implemented and tested  
**Commit**: `56af078` - "Fix timestamp insertion race condition"  
**Description**: Fixed the blur/click race condition when adding timestamps
- Added `onMouseDown` preventDefault to timestamp button
- Added setTimeout wrapper in handleAddTimestamp 
- Added auto-edit fallback in insertSegmentTimestamp
- Added delayed blur handler as backup

**Result**: Timestamp insertion now works reliably in the workflow

### 2. Advanced Word Matching Algorithm ‚úÖ  
**Status**: Fully implemented and integrated  
**Commit**: `c89e08c` - "Implement advanced word matching algorithm for 99% accuracy"  
**Description**: Implemented the Python-based matching algorithm for 99% accuracy
- Added `normalizeToken` function with advanced punctuation handling
- Added `tokensCloseMatch` for plural/suffix drift handling
- Implemented `advancedWordMatching` with lookahead window approach
- Updated DataContext to use advanced matching instead of basic alignment

**Files Modified**:
- `services/processingService.ts` - New matching algorithm functions
- `contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Updated to use advanced matching

**Result**: Now provides 99% accuracy for Montreal alignment, potentially 100% for WhisperX

## üîÑ REMAINING WORK FOR NEXT AGENT

Based on the original user requirements, these improvements still need implementation:

### 1. Enhanced Enter Key Behavior üéØ
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Goal**: Press Enter ‚Üí new paragraph stays editable ‚Üí cursor at start ‚Üí ready for timestamp

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// File: components/TranscriptView.tsx
// In saveParagraph function, after paragraph split:
if (shouldEnterEditMode) {
    nextEditingParaIndex.current = newParagraphIndex;
    // Position cursor at start of new paragraph
}
```

**User Workflow**: 
1. Double-click paragraph ‚Üí editable
2. Press Enter ‚Üí creates new paragraph AND keeps it editable 
3. Cursor positioned at start of new paragraph
4. Ready to click "Add Timestamp" immediately

### 2. Remove Auto-Pause on Edit üéµ
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Goal**: Let audio continue playing when entering edit mode

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// File: components/Editor.tsx, line ~296
const handleEditStart = useCallback(() => {
    // REMOVE or comment out this auto-pause behavior:
    // if (audioRef.current && !audioRef.current.paused) {
    //     audioRef.current.pause();
    // }
}, [audioRef]);
```

### 3. Fix Play at Word During Playback ‚èØÔ∏è
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Goal**: Allow seeking to word timestamps even while audio is playing

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// File: components/Editor.tsx - handleSeekToTime function
const handleSeekToTime = (time: number | null) => {
    if (audioRef.current && time !== null) {
        const audio = audioRef.current;
        audio.currentTime = time;
        // REMOVE the pause check - allow seeking during playback
        // if (audio.paused) {
        //     const playPromise = audio.play();
        //     ...
        // }
    }
};
```

### 4. Timeline Synchronization Verification üîÑ
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Goal**: Ensure timeline scrolling works correctly with new matching algorithm

**Testing Needed**:
- Verify `timeToScrollTo` effect in Editor.tsx works with improved word matching
- Test word index calculations are accurate 
- Ensure smooth scrolling to correct positions

## üöÄ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW FOR NEXT AGENT

### Before Starting Work:
```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/timestamp-editing-workflow-improvements

# 3. Verify build works
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev  # Test in browser
```

### During Development:
1. ‚úÖ Follow the patterns established in existing code
2. ‚úÖ Make incremental commits with clear messages
3. ‚úÖ Test each improvement individually
4. ‚úÖ Keep the race condition fixes intact

### After Implementation:
```bash
# 1. Run quality checks
npm run build  # Verify no build errors
npx tsc --noEmit  # Check TypeScript

# 2. Commit your changes
git add <modified-files>
git commit -m "feat(transcript): Implement enhanced timestamp editing workflow

- Keep new paragraph editable after Enter key press
- Remove auto-pause when entering edit mode  
- Allow play-at-word during active playback
- Position cursor at start of new paragraph for timestamp insertion"

# 3. Push and merge following AGENTS.md workflow
git push origin feature/timestamp-editing-workflow-improvements
git checkout main
git merge feature/timestamp-editing-workflow-improvements
git push origin main
git branch -d feature/timestamp-editing-workflow-improvements
```

## üß™ TESTING PRIORITIES

### Critical User Workflow Test:
1. Upload audio file ‚úÖ
2. Load speaker timeline (Pyannote JSON) ‚úÖ  
3. Load transcript text ‚úÖ
4. Double-click timeline segment ‚Üí button turns green ‚úÖ
5. Double-click paragraph ‚Üí enters edit mode ‚úÖ
6. Press Enter ‚Üí **NEW**: paragraph splits, new one stays editable
7. **NEW**: Cursor positioned at start of new paragraph  
8. Click "Add Timestamp" ‚Üí **WORKS** (race condition fixed ‚úÖ)
9. **NEW**: Audio continues playing throughout process
10. **NEW**: Can use "play at word" during playback

### Advanced Features to Verify:
- Advanced word matching accuracy with MFA/Whisper uploads ‚úÖ
- Timeline-transcript synchronization 
- Version history preservation
- Keyboard shortcuts still functional

## üîç DEBUGGING TIPS

### Common Issues to Watch For:
1. **Enter Key Behavior**: Make sure paragraph splitting doesn't exit edit mode prematurely
2. **Cursor Positioning**: Ensure new paragraph gets focus at the right position
3. **Audio Control**: Verify seek operations don't interfere with continuous playback
4. **State Management**: Keep version history and context state intact

### Debugging Tools:
- React DevTools for context state inspection
- Browser console for audio element state  
- Performance profiler for canvas timeline if issues arise
- Network tab for any API-related problems

---

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION HINTS

### For Enter Key Enhancement:
Look at the `nextEditingParaIndex.current` pattern already established in TranscriptView.tsx - extend this to handle the new paragraph case.

### For Audio Continuity:
The audio element state is managed through `audioRef.current` - be careful not to break existing playback controls.

### For Play-at-Word:
The existing `handleSeekToTime` function just needs the pause check removed - the audio element handles seeking during playback natively.
